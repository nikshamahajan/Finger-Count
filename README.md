# Finger-Count
Applied the pivotal concept of convex hull in the domain of hand gesture analysis and precise finger counting. Leveraged the convex hull algorithm to proficiently segment the hand, thereby establishing clear boundaries and extracting vital geometric attributes. This strategic incorporation facilitated accurate finger detection and counting by allowing the algorithm to concentrate on pertinent hand characteristics while effectively filtering out inconsequential background elements. The integration of the convex hull technique substantially elevated the accuracy and dependability of the finger counting algorithm, highlighting a strong command over computer vision principles and their practical application.
